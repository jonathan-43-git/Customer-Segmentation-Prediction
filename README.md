# Customer-Segmentation-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer segmentations, where the target variable classifies customers into 4 big segments, which are A, B, C, or D. The process starts with exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions, detect outliers, and explore relationships between variables. The data cleaning steps included removing duplicate rows, handling missing values, and applying encoding techniques to convert categorical variables into numerical form in order to make the modelling process easier and more accurate.  

After preprocessing, i use 2 machine learning models for training the data, which are the Random Forest and XGBoost. The model performance was evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics, with XGBoost providing the best results. This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in building robust customer segmentation models which can help the businesses out there to plan the strategies for each different customer groups.  

Note: This project was a class assignment, and the joke part was required by the lecturer.
